<H3>Bricx Command Center 3.3</H3>
<P><B>Bricx Command Center</B> (BricxCC) is a Windows (95, 98, ME, NT, W2K, XP, Vista) program commonly known as 
an integrated development environment (IDE) for programming the RCX (all versions), Scout, 
Cybermaster, and Spybot programmable bricks using Dave Baum's Not Quite C (NQC) language.  And it
supports programming the Scout, RCX2, and Spybot using The LEGO Company's MindScript(tm) and LASM(tm) 
languages via the Mindstorms 2.5 SDK.  It supports programming RCX bricks in C, C++, Pascal,
Forth, and Java using the brickOS, pbForth, and leJOS alternate firmwares.
BricxCC now also supports programming the new LEGO Mindstorms NXT brick using Not eXactly C (NXC), 
Next Byte Codes (NBC), and a simple on-brick programming language called NPG.
</P>
<P>
Version 3.3 of BricxCC is an enhanced revision to Mark Overmars' original program.  See his 
<a href="http://www.cs.uu.nl/people/markov/lego/">web page</a> for
an overview of the basic functionality upon which this release was built.</P>

<p>Download the 
<A href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=68600&package_id=67285">latest version</A>
or a recent <a href="test_releases/">test release</a> of BricxCC with full support 
for the new NXT brick!  And download a release of a command line compiler for the Next Byte Codes
(<a href="nbc/">NBC</a>) programming language which lets you write programs for the NXT brick in 
a text-based assembly language.</p>
<p>Check out <b>Not eXactly C</b>!  <a href="nxc/">Not eXactly C</a> (NXC) is a high-level C-like programming 
language for the NXT programmable brick which is built on top of NBC.  If you get the latest
release of NBC then you can also program the NXT using NXC.  
NXC is designed to be very similar to NQC so that learning to use
this new language should be easy if you already know NQC.
Version 3.3.7.16 of BricxCC or greater is required if you want to program using NXC.
You can also find help for the <a target="_blank" href="nbc/nxcdoc/nxcapi/index.html">NXC API</a> functions on the
NBC page. A compiled help is also available from the NXC Docs page.  There are 
viewers available for the compiled help format for 
<a href="http://www.linux.com/news/software/applications/8209-chm-viewers-for-linux">linux</a> and
<a href="http://chmox.sourceforge.net/">Mac OS X</a>.
</p>
<p>To take advantage of multi-dimensional array support and native shift and wait operations
be sure to download the enhanced <a href="lms_arm_nbcnxc.zip">NBC/NXC firmware</a> and install it on your NXT
using the Download Firmware tool in BricxCC.  You can also download the enhanced NBC/NXC firmware 
<a href="lms_arm_nbcnxc_src.zip">source code</a> if you want.
</p>
<p>If you are using NBC you need to check out the NBC Debugger from Tamas Sorosy.  Download it
from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sorosy.com/lego/nxtdbg/">www.sorosy.com</a>.  You will
be amazed at how easy it makes debugging your NBC programs.
</p>
<p>
Communication with the NXT requires that the 
<a href="http://cache.lego.com/upload/contentTemplating/Mindstorms2SupportFilesDownloads/otherfiles/download936C391AD9DAA7CB4AA9A9ADBEED89FB.zip">
Mindstorms NXT Driver v1.02</a> or newer is installed.  The zip can be found on the 
<a href="http://mindstorms.lego.com/en-us/support/files/default.aspx#Driver">MINDSTORMS Update</a> page.  If you have any 
difficulties communicating with your NXT you may not have the Fantom drivers installed 
properly.  See the <a href="NXTFantomDriverHelp.pdf">NXT Fantom Driver Help</a> document for assistance.
</p>
</ul>

<H3>Downloading</H3>
<P>The most recent version of BricxCC is version 3.3 which uses NQC 2.3r1 or later.  
<em>NQC version 2.4r1 or <a href="nqc/release/nqc-win-3-1-r6.zip">later</a></em> 
is required for full USB tower support - 
downloading programs will not work with earlier versions of NQC.  
<em>NQC version 2.5a1 or later</em> is required for NQC Spybot support.  
NQC 3.1r5 is now included
in the BricxCC distribution so you do not have to download it separately from the new 
<a href="nqc/">NQC website</a>.</P>

<H3>Installation</H3>
<P>To install Bricx Command Center, perform the following simple steps:</P>
<ul>
<li>Run the Bricxcc setup executable.  Follow the setup wizard instructions.
If you choose a custom install you can select whether to install the NQC Tutorial
(written by Mark Overmars with a few minor revisions by John Hansen).  You can 
also choose whether to install the NQC Compiler.  If you already have NQC installed you 
may wish to deselect this option.  To enable full support for MindScript and LASM you should
choose to install the LCC32 command-line compiler (this is installed by default).
<li>(Optional but recommended) 
To get the very latest features and support for the newest LEGO programmable bricks
you should download and extract the <a href="test_release.zip">test release</a> of
BricxCC.  Make sure the directory structure in the zip is maintained when you extract the files.
<li>(Optional) To enable WinHelp support under Vista you will need to download and install the Microsoft
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=6EBCFAD9-D3F5-4365-8070-334CD175D4BB&displaylang=en">WinHelp viewer</a>.
<li>(Optional) Download and extract the latest version of NQC.  The NQC executable (nqc.exe) 
must be in a directory on your PATH or in the same directory as BricxCC.exe.  The LCC 
executable (lcc32.exe) must be similarly located.
<li>(Optional) Download and install the <a href="http://www.philohome.com/sdk25/sdk25.htm">
LEGO Mindstorms SDK 2.5</a> to enable MindScript and LASM compile and download support for RCX2, Scout, 
and Spybot bricks.
<li>(Optional) To enable RCX brickOS C/C++/Pascal support and leJOS Java support you can now download
an all-in-one <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/bricxcc/BricxCCSetupCygwin.exe?download">
setup executable</a> which installs a small subset of cygwin along with pre-built
H8 tools.  NOTE: If you get an error when you try to run the installer that it is missing
BricxCCSetupCygwin.002 that means the download did not complete successfully.  Please try to download it
again during off-peak hours or using a download manager utility of some sort.  Once you have successfully 
downloaded and installed the cygwin configuration and H8 compiler tools then 
install the <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/bricxcc/BricxCCbrickOSleJOS.exe?download">
minimal brickOS and leJOS for BricxCC</a> and you are ready to go (except for leJOS, which still needs to have a 
separately installed <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/downloads.html">Java Developers Kit</a>).

earlier revisions.</p>

<H3>FAQ</H3>
<p>See the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> page for answers to frequently asked BricxCC questions.</p> 

<H3>Source Code</H3>
<P>I firmly believe in the power of the Open Source movement.  Because Mark 
generously made his source code available I've been able to make the enhancements
that are in BricxCC 3.3.  So I'm similarly sharing my revised BricxCC source code for
all to benefit thereby.  BricxCC is written in Delphi. It is a rather 
extensive program so don't start working on it unless you are an 
experienced Delphi programmer. The source code is distributed under the 
Mozilla Public Licence.  Since I am actively enhancing BricxCC I'd like to receive
a copy of any bug fixes or enhancements.</P>
